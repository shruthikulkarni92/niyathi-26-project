This is the recipe for Chocolate Marble Cake

It is very easy to make. It is soft and is filled chocolaty delight. Once it is made, it becomes fluffy and spongy. 
It is an interesting fusion cake recipe made by combining 2 cake batter. The batter is mixed in such way that there are 2 distinct colors clearly visible overlapping each other. This is later baked like any other traditional cake and thus forming a zebra-like an appearance with 2 distinct colours from chocolate and plain cake batter.You can also create a beautiful design on it. It is one of my favourite cakes. You should also try this interesting recipe.

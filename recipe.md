Step by step Recipe

Preheat oven to 180C / 350F

Grease a cake tin of choice with some butter. I used my silicone bundt pan which needs no greasing.

Place the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla essence and milk in a bowl.

Beat slowly with a whisk to moisten, then beat with an electric mixer (or vigorously by hand) at medium speed for about two minutes until the batter is smooth.

Reserve three-fourth cup batter and pour the remainder into the cake pan.

Stir cocoa into the three-fourth cup reserved batter. You can add cocoa to more of the batter depending on which flavour you want dominating.

Drop the chocolate batter by the spoonfuls on top of the white batter.

Using a knife, swirl the cocoa batter into the white batter to give it a marbled effect.

Bake for 35-40 minutes in the preheated oven. Check with a skewer to see if the cake is done.

Remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Marble cake is delicious without any frosting but a light dusting of icing sugar wonâ€™t hurt.
